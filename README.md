__Project Title:__ Password Protected Diary App 

__Project Description:__

Our app will load up with a screen welcoming the user and directing them to press a button and enter a password to access their notes. If the password is entered correctly, they will be able see a list of notes with the name of the note as a label, then clicking on it will reveal the note itself. There will also be 2 buttons to add new notes and delete notes that are not needed. If the user leaves the screen that shows all the notes, then to go back to that page they will have to re-enter the password. If we have time, we might add a feature to change your password or to edit currently saved notes.
